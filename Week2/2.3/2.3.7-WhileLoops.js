// Create a while loop that TOTALS the numbers from 1 to 100 by following these steps...

// 1) create a variable to represent the current number
let curNum = 100;
// 2) create a variable to represent the current total
let curTotal = 0;
// 3) write a while loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 100
while (i <= curNum){
    curTotal += i;
console.log(curTotal);
    i++;
}
console.log(curTotal);
